# S3DropBucket Admin Scripts 

The scripts comtained in this folder are useful for maintaining the S3DropBucket environment such as S3 Buckets. SQS Queues and other AWS assets. 

Many have been generated using the AWS Q AI engine. 
It's been noted that AWS Q AI is not always 100% correct, so be careful when using these scripts and always take advantage of any LIMIT parameters and/or --DRY_RUN parameters to test before using for actual cleanup and maintenance.
